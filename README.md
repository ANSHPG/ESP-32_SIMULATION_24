# ESP-32_SIMULATION_SIH_24
The ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller processes data and manages Wi-Fi communication in the Acoustic-Based Rail Defect Detection System. It receives digital signals from the ICS-43434 Acoustic Sensor, stores data on an SD Card Module, and is powered by a 3.3V, 3A Power Supply, regulated by a Voltage Regulator.
